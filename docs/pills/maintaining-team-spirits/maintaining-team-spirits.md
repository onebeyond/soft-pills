# Maintaining Team Spirits

### 1. Context

Team meetings are often serious and chasing deadlines, colleagues never really have time to talk or build relationships outside of that those meetings, often leading to rigid and cold environments between colleagues.

### 2. Actions

Fortnightly meetings for social activities such as games, quizes for the colleagues to let their hair down (if they have any).
Games such as skribbl, geoguessr, sporcle, kahoot, garticphone and contexto.

### 3. Result

Teams feel like there is at least one meeting they really look forward to in order to take a break from the daily stresses.

They have a moment to have fun with their colleauges and maybe get in touch with their competitive side.

Not every meeting needs to be serious and with this, the team feels closer than than they do before.

Full credit goes to Don Baumann for implementing this as a newcomer to the team.
