# Proactivity Against Isolation

### 1. Context

When working for clients that are large organizations, an external team can sometimes feel isolated and uninvolved in the company's achievements.

Sometimes this feeling of isolation is due to a communication bottleneck that prevents participation in decision making or the mere creation of a backlog of tasks.

### 2. Actions

The team meets weekly to promote a specific action that benefits the product/service or simply improves development processes.

The Lead team must transfer this proposal to a higher level for its possible implementation.

### 3. Result

This measure can have several benefits:

- Strengthens relationships between team members.
- Improves the feeling of usefulness of the entire team
- Although it may not be immediate, this iteration improves the team's visibility in the client's organization and can generate synergies with other teams that adopt these measures or want to participate in them.
- You can overcome the bottleneck and find other means of communication.
